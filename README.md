# Anki Developing Environment Set Up

For anyone who is having trouble with setting up Pycharm for developing Anki addon.
So I tried to use Python version 3.13 for developing Anki addon but it's not working on my end.
Then, I checked again and found that Anki is most stable with Python version 3.9
Thus, download Python 3.9 and then set up a virtual environment to develop your Anki plugin

For MacOS user,

First, install Python 3.9
brew install python@3.9
